**Authors:** Fakii Mohammed, Andrew Ogembo, Chiboniso Nyoni, Peterson Kagir  
**Group:** 67 AI Software Engineers

## Objective
Train a lightweight image classification model to recognize recyclable items, convert it to TensorFlow Lite, and test on a sample dataset.

## Steps
1. Train a MobileNetV2 model on a recyclable items dataset (e.g., Kaggle).
2. Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite.
3. Test the TFLite model on sample images.
4. Report accuracy and deployment steps.

## Edge AI Benefits
Edge AI enables real-time classification on devices, reducing latency and enhancing privacy by processing data locally. This is crucial for applications like smart recycling bins or mobile apps for waste sorting.
