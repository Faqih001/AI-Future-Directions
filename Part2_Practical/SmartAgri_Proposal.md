# Smart Agriculture System Proposal

**Authors:** Fakii Mohammed, Andrew Ogembo, Chiboniso Nyoni, Peterson Kagiri  
**Group:** 67 AI Software Engineers

## Sensors Needed
- Soil moisture sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Humidity sensor
- Light sensor
- pH sensor

## AI Model
A regression model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor) can be used to predict crop yields based on sensor data.

## Data Flow Diagram
1. Sensors collect real-time data from the field.
2. Data is sent to an IoT gateway.
3. AI model processes data and predicts yield.
4. Results are sent to farmers via a dashboard or mobile app.
