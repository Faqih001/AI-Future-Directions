AI models trained on datasets like the Cancer Genomic Atlas may exhibit biases due to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups. This can lead to less effective or even harmful treatment recommendations for minorities. To address this, it is crucial to:
- Use diverse, representative training data.
- Regularly audit models for bias.
- Involve domain experts in model validation.
- Implement fairness-aware algorithms.

These strategies help ensure equitable healthcare outcomes and build trust in AI-driven personalized medicine.
