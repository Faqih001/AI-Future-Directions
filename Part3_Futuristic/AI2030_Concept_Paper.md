**Authors:** Fakii Mohammed, Andrew Ogembo, Chiboniso Nyoni  
**Group:** 67 AI Software Engineers

## Problem Statement
Climate change poses severe risks to global ecosystems and human societies. Traditional mitigation methods are slow and often insufficient.

## Proposed Solution
An AI-powered climate engineering platform that monitors atmospheric data, simulates intervention strategies (e.g., carbon capture, solar radiation management), and autonomously deploys solutions in real time.

## AI Workflow
- **Data Inputs:** Satellite imagery, sensor networks, climate models.
- **Model Type:** Deep reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making.
- **Process:** AI analyzes data, predicts outcomes, and optimizes interventions.

## Societal Risks and Benefits
- **Benefits:** Accelerates climate response, reduces human error, enables global coordination.
- **Risks:** Potential for unintended ecological consequences, ethical concerns over geoengineering, and governance challenges.
