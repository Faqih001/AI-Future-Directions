## Q1: Edge AI vs. Cloud-Based AI

Edge AI processes data locally on devices, reducing latency by eliminating the need to send data to remote servers. This enhances privacy, as sensitive data remains on the device. For example, autonomous drones use Edge AI to make split-second navigation decisions without relying on cloud connectivity, ensuring real-time responsiveness and data security.

## Q2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI in Optimization

Quantum AI leverages quantum computing's ability to process complex computations in parallel, offering exponential speedup for certain optimization problems compared to classical AI. Industries like pharmaceuticals, logistics, and finance could benefit most, as quantum algorithms can solve problems like drug discovery, route optimization, and portfolio management more efficiently.

## Q3: Societal Impact of Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare

Human-AI collaboration in healthcare can augment professionals such as radiologists and nurses by automating routine tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and enabling personalized care. This transformation allows healthcare workers to focus on complex cases and patient interaction, potentially improving outcomes but also requiring new skills and ethical considerations.
